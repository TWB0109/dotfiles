# This is the configuration file for konsave. This file is pre-configured for KDE Plasma users.
# This will backup all the important files for your Plasma customizations.
# Please make sure it follows the correct format for proper working of konsave.
# The format should be:

#         entries: 
#         # these are files to be backed up. They should be present in the specified location.

# export:

# You can use these variables and functions in the locations of different entries:
# $HOME: the home directory
# $PROFILES_DIR: directory where all profiles are saved
# $CONFIG_DIR: refers to "$HOME/.config/"
# $KONSAVE_DIR: the location where all Konsave files are stored ("$CONFIG_DIR/konsave").
# ${ENDS_WITH="text"}: for folders with different names on different computers whose names end with the same thing.
# The best example for this is the ".default-release" folder for firefox.
# ${BEGINS_WITH="text"}: for folders with different names on different computers whose names start with the same thing.
