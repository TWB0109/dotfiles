When it's lovely
I believe in anything
What does love mean, when the end is rolling in? Oh
Let it go, let it stay
Can we love one another
Cold, is it safe to be warm in the summer?
Who knows (Who knows)
I said who knows

Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go
I can't believe that I'm not enough
Not enough
And so long, no one will be here to save you
And no one will be here to let you know
Let you know
This is your world
(This is your world)
This is your world
(This is your world)

Quietly still, in a lie, oh, good night
I don't mind

Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go
I can't believe that I'm not enough
Not enough
And so long, no one will be here to save you
And no one will be here to let you know
Let you know
