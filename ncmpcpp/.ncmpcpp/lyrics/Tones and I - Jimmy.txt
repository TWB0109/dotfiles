To escape from all the fighting
He was always told that he wasn't right
So he just kept on writing
Writing to a dad that he wished he'd had

We should run away but today we'll stay
And I haven't seen him since that day now I got

Jimmy on my mind felt like yesterday
But I don't see him anymore, anymore
Jimmy he got tired so he couldn't stay

Jimmy would come over after school sometimes
And we'd dance around the garden
He would never talk but when he would try
It would never come out right and

Now I don't see him anymore, anymore

We said that someday we would leave this all behind
Now I got

Jimmy on my mind felt like yesterday
But I don't see him anymore, anymore
Jimmy he got tired so he couldn't stay
Now I don't see him anymore, now I got
Jimmy on my mind feels like yesterday
But I don't see him anymore, anymore
Jimmy he got tired but he couldn't stay
Now I don't see him anymore, anymore
Nah nah, no no
