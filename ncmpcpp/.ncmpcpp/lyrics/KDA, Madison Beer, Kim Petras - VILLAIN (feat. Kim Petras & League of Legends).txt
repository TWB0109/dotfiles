On the low
Only love myself, no more
Take you to the grave, I'll ghost
I know I can be so cold

In the dark
Where I like to keep my heart
Know I'm all bite, no bark
Like to catch you way off guard

I'll stay so deep inside your brain
And take you somewhere far away

Time to roll the dice
You know I'm the type
Type to risk my life
Not afraid to die
Type to make you cry
Type to put a price
All up on your head
Do just what I said

I'm a straight up villain, straight up villain
Yeah, no feeling, yeah, no feeling
Straight up villain, straight up villain
Yeah, no feeling, yeah, no feeling

I'm alive, but I'm dead
Hear my voice up in your head
Watch it fill you full of dread
Till you go pow

Is it really a surprise
If I'm playing with your mind?
And I treat you like a prize
Then I throw you to the side
And am I really that bad
If I love to make you mad?
And get happy when you're sad
Only care about a bag

In control, that's how I like it
And I'm never letting go, nah
Never had a soul
So you ain't taking nothing from me
When you go, nah

I'll stay so deep inside your brain
And take you somewhere far away

Time to roll the dice
You know I'm the type
Type to risk my life
Not afraid to die
Type to make you cry
Type to put a price
All up on your head
Do just what I said

I'm a straight up villain, straight up villain
Yeah, no feeling, yeah, no feeling
Straight up villain, straight up villain
Yeah, no feeling, yeah, no feeling

I'm alive, but I'm dead
Hear my voice up in your head
Watch it fill you full of dread
Till you go pow

Bang, bang, you can do anything
No fear, no pain
Listen to your brain go
Go stupid, go dumb, go stupid and
Then we go insane, whoa
Just do what I say
Follow me, I'll lead the way

Time to roll the dice
You know I'm the type
Type to risk my life
Not afraid to die
Type to make you cry
Type to put a price
All up on your head
Do just what I said

I'm a straight up villain, straight up villain
Yeah, no feeling, yeah, no feeling
Straight up villain, straight up villain
Yeah, no feeling, yeah, no feeling

I'm alive, but I'm dead
Hear my voice up in your head
Watch it fill you full of dread
Till you go pow
