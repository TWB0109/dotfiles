Aye, man, c'mon man don't leave
Fuck, what the fuck
Why you leave me on read
I don't like this, fuck
Ahh

If I told you what I'm thinking 'bout
It's hard to say to you but
I just know that I need some time alone
It's all I think about at night

I need some time away from you
Can't even be in the same room
I think I'm going crazy
Been home and lonely lately
What do you think about me
Can you fight or will you flee
Call me, you got my number
Don't let me go yet lover

You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know, that I know
That you're not coming home
These days, I'm lost, you left me to drown, to drown

Perdido en mi mente y buscando paraíso
But I can not find that si no estas aquí conmigo
Don't know what you're doing and I don't know who you with
En ruinas reina, sin tu yo aquí me quede
Con mis esperanzas falsas, casi siento que me matan
Regresa conmigo
Amor where did we go

I need some time away from you
Can't even be in the same room
I think I'm going crazy
Been home and lonely lately
What do you think about me
Can you fight or will you flee
Call me, you got my number
Don't let me go yet lover

You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know, that I know
That you're not coming home
These days, I'm lost, you left me to drown, to drown

Stuck inside my mind I think I've lost it all
Free me from my thoughts, I think I've fallen off
Memories don't return, they seem to melt away
Dreaming of a world where I would wanna stay

You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone
You know, that I know
That you're not coming home
These days, I'm lost, you left me to drown, to drown
