Wide awake, getting half past zero
It's getting heated so I leave the windows open (Leave the windows open)
Preoccupied with the late night B-roll
Right now, laying here alone is heaven (alone is heaven)

And I've been a hero
Helpless
I'm in Hell

And I've cried
Up and down in these hallways
Blame myself

Bad luck, I don't wanna be home at midnight
Sun's up, I don't really wanna fight the daylight
I don't care if you moved on
I'm not laying in bed with a fucked up head
I'm not laying in bed with a fucked up

Sun-dried on the backyard patio
Drunk eyes
'Cause I didn't give it a home run

You're hiding on the FM radio
I sing along just to sing my thoughts at someone

And I've been a hero
Helpless
I'm in Hell

And I've cried
Up and down in these hallways
Blame myself

Bad luck, I don't wanna be home at midnight
Sun's up, I don't really wanna fight the daylight
I don't care if you moved on
I'm not laying in bed with a fucked up head
I'm not laying in bed with a fucked up
