[Romanized:]

Nae nune bichin changmun
Nuneul gama
Barami buneun gose
Nal deryeoga
Wanna be myself
Wanna leave this hell
Kkeonaejwo jebal
Stuck in a place between
The space of heart and mind
Siganeul jjocha kkumeul chaja heulleoga
And so am I

Drop
Sit on the floor
Thinking I'll stop
Can't take no more
Junbidoel ttae
Keuge nan Roar
That was the battle but this is the war

I'll show you what I'm made of
Rise to the occasion
Got fears but I face them
And I'll show you what I'm made of
A heart full of fire
Looking at a fighter

I got a way, it depends on the day
That I forget I'm the best, that's done it
Hard on myself, put my heart on a shelf
'Cause I forget that myself needs loving
Eodume garyeojin
Gieok modu ijen ijeo
'Cause I know that I can make it out those days

Drop
Sit on the floor
Thinking I'll stop
Can't take no more
Junbidoel ttae
Keuge nan Roar
That was the battle but this is the war

I'll show you what I'm made of
Rise to the occasion
Got fears but I face them
And I'll show you what I'm made of
A heart full of fire
Looking at a fighter

Eodumbodan balgeumi deo keujana
Neoui gachireul neoga jal aljana
You know the darker the day
The more you shine

Eoduumi jina balgeun haruga Babe
You don't have to be afraid

And I'm not 'cause today
I'll show you what I'm made of
Rise to the occasion
Got fears but I face them
And I'll show you what I'm made of
A heart full of fire
Looking at a fighter

I'll show you what I'm made of
I'll show you what I'm made of
I'll show you

[Korean:]

내 눈에 비친 창문
눈을 감아
바람이 부는 곳에
날 데려가
Wanna be myself
Wanna leave this hell
꺼내줘 제발
Stuck in a place between
The space of heart and mind
시간을 쫓아 꿈을 찾아 흘러가
And so am I

Drop
Sit on the floor
Thinking I'll stop
Can't take no more
준비될 때
크게 난 Roar
That was the battle but this is the war

I'll show you what I'm made of
Rise to the occasion
Got fears but I face them
And I'll show you what I'm made of
A heart full of fire
Looking at a fighter

I got a way, it depends on the day
That I forget I'm the best, that's done it
Hard on myself, put my heart on a shelf
'Cause I forget that myself needs loving
어둠에 가려진
기억 모두 이젠 잊어
'Cause I know that I can make it out those days

Drop
Sit on the floor
Thinking I'll stop
Can't take no more
준비될 때
크게 난 Roar
That was the battle but this is the war

I'll show you what I'm made of
Rise to the occasion
Got fears but I face them
And I'll show you what I'm made of
A heart full of fire
Looking at a fighter

어둠보단 밝음이 더 크잖아
너의 가치를 너가 잘 알잖아
You know the darker the day
The more you shine

어두움이 지나 밝은 하루가 Babe
You don't have to be afraid

And I'm not 'cause today
I'll show you what I'm made of
Rise to the occasion
Got fears but I face them
And I'll show you what I'm made of
A heart full of fire
Looking at a fighter

I'll show you what I'm made of
I'll show you what I'm made of
I'll show you
