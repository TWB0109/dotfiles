[Rex Orange County:]
When we first spent the night
Nothing else would ever feel that way
In my room it all changed

And I could see something in your eye
I knew that nothing else would be the same
But I wish that I could grow up, they way in which you grow up
Cause then you'd never see me cry
And I'd feel like a better guy
Cause nothing, nothing
Oh, nothing, no
I said that nothing else would ever be the same

When we first spent the night
No, nothing else could ever feel that way
In my room it all changed, yeah

[Marco McKinnis:]
Nothing seems to be as floral as you, baby
A scarlet love and dew-light touches were so sacred
I could never leave your face
Shower you with my warm embrace, babe

And I can see that in your eyes
I hope that nothing will ever change
Cause I wish that I could grow up, the way in which you grow up
Cause then I'd love myself and I, I'd feel like a better guy
Cause nothing, no, nothing
No, nothing, no
I said that nothing else would ever be the same
Same, same, same, be the same

[Rex Orange County:]
Cause lately I've been missing you, I just kinda want your body
I know I could ease the pain (Ease the pain)
And I know that you done missed me too, and if that's true, well I'm sorry
But at least I'm on my feet again, (Feet again)
But listen girl
Couldn't you tell I'm scared as well?
You could hold my hand (Say something... Say something)
Say something, something that could ease my pain
Ease my pain
