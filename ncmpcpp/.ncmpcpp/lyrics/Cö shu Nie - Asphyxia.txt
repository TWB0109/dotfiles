Far out of sight
A prisoner of the night
Hides a small child taking a final breath

Struggling to fill your lungs
You'll~ suffocate within this world you hate and -
There is nothing that you can do
Some things you just can't change
Open your eyes

Sinking deeper
Fading with the setting sun
This is my reality

I believed love would save me
But in the end the pain that cut so deeply is
Breaking me, taking everything
I only wish it would turn into love (ahh~)

Cut me down - End my misery
Because I loathe the joy I'm feeling

Lie to me like it's meant to be
Cause I don't care, it's all the same to me...
Let all the beauty fade and melt away aayyy ~

It's okay, no mistake
It's just who you are
You stay strong
But you are wondering how long you can keep the lie alive
When will you give it up?
I've had enough

Piece by piece
Breaking, shattering
But you don't let it show or let the world know
Your too far gone, but still you carry on
And now inside you break little more Ahh~

Every breath - Slowly tarnishing
I second guess my mind again, one last time

My enemy - Hide me underneath
How I despise this life I've locked away... Ahh~
Start anew in this time of peace
With darkness at your feet
So turn the key, and it will all begin
